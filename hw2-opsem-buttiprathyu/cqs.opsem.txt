For questions 1–5, please read pages 27–36 (the book sections on environments
and on operational semantics of expressions).

 1. ξ (or $\xi$) is an environment that maps names to:
    Ans : f - only the values of global variables

 2. ϕ (or $\phi$) is an environment that maps names to:
    Ans : c - both primitive and user-defined functions

 3. ρ (or $\rho$) is an environment that maps names to:
    Ans : b - only the values of formal parameters.

Choices for questions 1–3:

  a. only user-defined functions.
  b. only the values of formal parameters.
  c. both primitive and user-defined functions.
  d. the values of both global variables and formal parameters.
  e. only primitive functions.
  f. only the values of global variables.

 4. In operational semantics, what kind of a thing does e stand for?
    Ans : c - an expression

 5. In operational semantics, what kind of a thing does v stand for?
    Ans : d - a value

Choices for questions 4 and 5:

  a. a variable
  b. an elaboration
  c. an expression
  d. a value
  e. a function

For questions 6 and 7, please read Section 1.1.6 (page 23) on the 
difference between primitive functions and predefined functions, and 
please study the rules for function application in Section 1.4.6, which starts 
on page 34.

 6. Function <= is in the initial basis but is not a primitive function (it is 
    a predefined function). When evaluating (<= 0 n), what rule of the 
    operational semantics is used at the root of the derivation?
    Ans : a, b - ApplyLessThanEqTrue and ApplyLessThanEqFalse

 7. Function < is primitive. When evaluating (< n 10), what rule of the 
    operational semantics is used at the root of the derivation?
    Ans : d, e - ApplyLessThanTrue and ApplyLessThanFalse

Choices for questions 6 and 7:

  a. ApplyLessThanEqTrue
  b. ApplyLessThanEqFalse
  c. ApplyUser
  d. ApplyLessThanTrue
  e. ApplyLessThanFalse
  f. ApplyPrim
